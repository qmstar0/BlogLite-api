# NightSky-Api

[中文](./README.MD)|[English]

> This project aims to provide API services for the nightsky project.

This project is an API system built based on the principles of DDD (Domain-Driven Design) and CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation), designed to offer a clear and scalable backend service.

## Key Features
- **CQRS Architecture Support**:
  - Command side handles write operations (create, update, delete).
  - Query side handles read operations (retrieve article, category, and tag information).
- **DDD Design Principles**:
  - Domain-driven design with well-defined boundaries for aggregates, entities, and value objects.

## Environment Requirements
- Golang 1.22+

## Future Plans
- Enhanced and robust authentication mechanisms.
- Plug-and-play modular architecture.
- Performance optimizations.
